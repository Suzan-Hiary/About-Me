<h2>My Ambition</h2>

“On average, ambitious people attain higher levels of education and income, build more prestigious careers, and report higher overall
 levels of life satisfaction,” says Neel Burton, psychiatrist and author of Heaven and Hell: The Psychology of the Emotions. “Many of 
 man’s greatest achievements are the products, or accidents, of their ambition.”

 Always in my whole life i thinking how to be special in every place i go ,i must given a good ambition but after i graduated and do my 
 best in school and unviersity i was shocked by the reailty there is no jobs chance . and i get depression after three years of my graduated
 and that  does not helpfull in my sutation . so i decided to get more deep in my major so i took a lots of course but it still not working 
 so i decided to get more skills far away from my major so i start studying a software developer hopply that will being usefull one day .
 i hope i will be a creative person one day and being proud .
